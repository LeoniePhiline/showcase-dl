# showcase-dl

*A parallel downloader to create private backups of embedded vimeo videos and vimeo showcases.*

## Why does this exist?

The need arose to secure a private backup of a some embedded vimeo showcases.

As it turned out, the almighty [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) did not support the creation of local backups from vimeo showcases.

This tool is the result of some initial tinkering to try and automate the extraction of data necessary to download vimeo showcase videos anyway.

This, however, soon turned into perfectionist yak shaving, ending up in a terminal user interface for parallel downloading of all embedded vimeo videos and vimeo showcases on a webpage.

## What does it do and how do I use it?

Currently no prebuilt binaries are provided. To compile the tool, simply get `rustup` and `cargo` by following the instructions at [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).

Then `git clone` this repository (or download as `.zip` file and extract), and run `cargo build --release` in the project folder. Cargo will make sure to download all dependencies from [crates.io](https://crates.io), install and compile them; then it will compile the app for you.

The finished executable binary will be found at `<project folder>/target/release/showcase-dl` on Linux or Mac,
or at `<project folder>/target/release/showcase-dl.exe` on Windows.

To start downloads, run the executable in your terminal, passing the target page's URL as only argument.

You can close the app at any time by pressing either the `Q` or `Esc` key, or the combination `Ctrl+C`.

As long as you do not close the app ahead of time, your videos will be downloaded concurrently, each in their own time.

![Partially finished](/img/In%20progress%2C%20partially%20finished.png)

After all downloads have finished, the app will remain open. This way, you can just go do other stuff, and come back to a nice status overview. Close the app with the `Q` or `Esc` key, or the combination `Ctrl+C`.

## Debugging

### Raising log verbosity

Using the `-v[v[v[v]]]` verbosity flag or the `RUST_LOG` environment variable, you can observe runtime information being written to `vimeo-showcase.log`.

Errors are always reported.

- `warn`: Only errors and warnings.
- `info`: Rough progress updates.
- `debug`: Fine grained progress updates and regular expression matches.
- `trace`: Full dumps of fetched HTML content.

#### Globally, using the `-v` CLI verbosity flag

Invoke `showcase-dl` with more `-v[v[v[v]]]` for more verbosity:

- `-v` is `warn`.
- `-vv` is `info`.
- `-vvv` is `debug`.
- `-vvvv` is `trace`.

#### Selectively, using environment variable

Use the [`EnvFilter`](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html) syntax
to target specific crates and raise verbosity in a finer grained manner.

**Example:** To only enable `debug` logging for `showcase-dl` itself, but not for its dependencies, set:

```bash
RUST_LOG=showcase_dl=debug
```

#### Observing log output

Use a split terminal, or a separate terminal window, to observe the live messages with (Linux, Mac):

```
tail -f vimeo-showcase.log
```

### Custom downloader

To use a custom version of `yt-dlp` or `youtube-dl`, pass the path to it via the `--bin` option, e.g.:

```
./target/release/showcase-dl --bin /path/to/yt-dlp/yt-dlp.sh -vvv <URL>  
```

## Disclaimer

This tool has been built to help create legal private backups of your own vimeo videos and showcases.

This tool does not itself download any video material. It merely spawns and sheperds processes of [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp).
